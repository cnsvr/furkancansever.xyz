I am a seasoned **Backend Engineer** with a diverse background in building and maintaining robust software solutions for various industries. Currently, I am thriving as a Backend Engineer at **Imaginite Studios**, where I lead the development and maintenance of backend services for casual mobile games, leveraging my expertise in **Java, Spring Boot, and AWS services** like **AWS EKS, SQS, RDS, DynamoDB**. Also, I am doing all configuration and deployment of the multiplayer game server for the game with **AWS GameLift**.

My journey in software development began as a **Full Stack Developer** at **Paraşüt Software Technology Corp.**, where I honed my skills in **Ruby on Rails** for developing RESTful APIs and **EmberJS** for frontend applications. Later, I expanded my knowledge as a **Backend Engineer** at **Gybe Games**, specializing in microservices development with **.NET, MongoDB, and AWS services**.

With a solid foundation in **Computer Engineering** from **Boğaziçi University**, I continuously strive to stay abreast of the latest technologies and frameworks. My passion for technology extends beyond the workplace, as I actively engage in personal projects and pursue learning opportunities to broaden my skill set.

Outside of the tech realm, I enjoy staying active through **tennis, kitesurfing and swimming**, as well as capturing moments through **photography**. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded professionals and contributing to innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact.

Let's connect and explore potential opportunities to collaborate and drive positive change together!
